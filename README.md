# Clue Helper
Clue helper is a simple command line program that is designed to give you a good suggestion for you to give on your turn. The suggestion is based on suggestions you and other players have given and who has responded to them. The helper tries to determine how likely it is other players have a certain card based on previous suggestions. Using the information, math and statistics determine what the best suggestion would be.

### To Run
There is an executable in this project, but if the executable is not working for you, you can compile using your favorite C++ compiler. For the example, I will use gcc. 
1. gcc main.cpp
2. ./a
